**Important:**

Please make sure that there is an existing issue that describes the problem solved by your pull request. If there isn't one, consider creating it first.
An open issue offers a good place to iron out requirements, discuss possible solutions, and ask questions.

Remember to also:

- Keep your pull request focused and as small as possible. If you want to contribute multiple unrelated changes, please create separate pull requests for them.
- Follow the coding style and conventions already established by the project. When in doubt about which style to use, ask in the comments to your pull request.
- If you want to start a discussion regarding a specific change you've made, add a review comment to your own code. This can be used to highlight something important or to seek further input from others.
